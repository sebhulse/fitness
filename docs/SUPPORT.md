## Support

This project is entirely open-source, and I encourage you to use the data and API in your own projects!
If you find this service valuable and/or would like to see further development with more features added, I'd ask that you support me through github.

**Some additional features I'd like to add:**
* Additional workout section types (like circuits, EMOMs, intervals etc)
* Real-time workout animation
* Additional equipment exercises - perhaps with dedicated crossfit exercises too (and the workout generation algorithms that come with it)

If these ideas sound like something you might be interested in, consider supporting or just reach out with motivation (I'm only human!).

See the [Github repository here](https://github.com/sebhulse/fitness) for the source code and support options.

Please feel free to reach out to me either on [Github](https://github.com/sebhulse) or [by email](https://sebhulse.com/#contact) with any ideas or suggestions!
