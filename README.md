This tool algorithmically generates random-ish workouts based on input options. Everything is open source and you can even use the open API in your own projects. 

It is hosted at [fitness.sebhulse.com](https://fitness.sebhulse.com).

See the .md files in the docs folder or the website for more information about the data, API, support, a guide and disclaimer/license.
