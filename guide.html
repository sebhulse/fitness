      <h2 id="2b8bf05c-b664-426c-9a01-30765c9b5c52" class="">What is this?</h2>
      <p id="84a09932-f265-4249-8e88-58a6305335eb" class="">So many buttons and options - what&#x27;s this all about? </p>
      <h3 id="82fde9d1-9d63-440e-832a-8f9f698147d1" class="">TL;DR</h3>
      <p id="72db7558-2e1c-40e9-b224-6297ccda17e8" class="">Algorithmically generated random-ish workouts based on input options. Everything is open source and you can even use the open API in your own projects. Please consider
        supporting/contributing!</p>
      <h3 id="7e8dc82c-0b0d-4fb8-8a42-305968e2b840" class="">Get Started</h3>
      <p id="f6771188-c359-4dea-833b-8f2d81933751" class="">Hi, welcome! </p>
      <p id="2ae22edd-5cac-48d2-88ed-83e8d48d47b8" class="">You&#x27;ve stumbled across an algorithmic workout generator - lucky you! Simply input your preferences for what kind of workout you&#x27;re feeling, and hit the Generate Workout
        button. All kinds of computer wizardry will happen in the background and in (much) less than a second, you&#x27;ll have a full workout presented to you, complete with warmup, varied workout sections, a finisher (good luck!), and a
        cooldown. </p>
      <p id="4f987b12-2422-4482-b34e-e210a4facb14" class="">Have a browse and see what you think of it - does it tickle your fancy? If not, no worries! Simply Re-Generate your Workout to create another workout using the same parameters, or
        Change your Options to go back to the first screen and re-select. </p>
      <p id="58dc111c-36cd-4038-b289-7b40b9ae02ee" class="">This tool is meant as workout inspiration, not a strict guide (ew) - I&#x27;m sure there are exercises that you&#x27;ll come across and think &quot;Eh? What are &#x27;Bear
        Crawls&#x27;??&quot; but that&#x27;s part of the fun! Improvise and have fun with it (safely)!</p>
      <p id="9e25fb92-14d9-422d-9b92-88e93228590b" class="">All of the workouts you generate are saved locally in the History section so you can easily go back, and you can clear them at any time. Just be aware that when you close your tab or
        browser, these workouts will be lost forever (if you&#x27;d like to see features like saving favourites added, let me know).</p>
      <p id="beb01197-dac1-4138-aa79-dc9eae5bead9" class="">Remember, these are computer-generated workouts which have not been approved by any personal trainer or otherwise qualified person, so don&#x27;t take them as gospel and do amend them
        as you see <em>fit</em> (get it?). See the disclaimer for more information. </p>
      <p id="b8a2002d-b4ca-4f71-bd01-232f675c05b9" class="">But wait, there&#x27;s more!</p>
      <h3 id="2837f094-7a66-40de-904a-338149e31df3" class="">API</h3>
      <p id="57d1c3c6-b597-46d8-a608-c0b785e21256" class="">This web-app is built around the central &#x27;workout generator&#x27; API, and it&#x27;s free to use for anybody! This means that you can implement it into your own projects under the
        CC BY 4.0 license. See the API page for more information.</p>
      <h3 id="51d93abf-33cf-402f-b56d-f3a65f90085f" class="">Data</h3>
      <p id="73b376e1-eaec-4bf7-adb7-a8ce3990b29d" class="">This project would be nothing without the data that underpins it - that is, the categorised workout exercises. Here&#x27;s the best bit - this data is open source too! I&#x27;d
        particularly love to have descriptions added to the workout to be more beginner friendly. Also, there are currently only bodyweight exercises, but I&#x27;m considering adding equipment exercises too. See the data section for more
        information.</p>
      <h3 id="6beb4691-bdee-4ae2-af86-99e2db7d5c68" class="">Support</h3>
      <p id="c36b61a9-c37f-4353-8ad8-a9ddf57a1e41" class="">As I&#x27;ve mentioned, this project is open-source and all contained in the same place, so please feel free to have a browse! If you would like to contribute to the data or the code -
        please do! If you find this resource valuable and would like to support another way, please consider sponsoring me to work on this project through Github. This helps me maintain the project and pay for the services that the API uses.
        Thanks!</p>
